- Designed and deployed a domain-specific LLM, leveraging Hugging Face, PyTorch, and scikit-learn, optimizing biological sequence interpretation.
- Built a pipeline to scrape, clean, and filter a 100K-entry dataset from UniProt using Python and SQL, refining it into a high-quality 10K dataset.
- Conducted an architectural analysis of state-of-the-art LLMs, evaluating their efficiency, scalability, and real-world applications.
- Used adversarial probing techniques to analyze attention mechanisms in LLMs, improving interpretability for protein-sequence prediction.
- Benchmarked models using accuracy, F1-score, and AUC-ROC, optimizing for performance and efficiency.
- Deployed the LLM on Google Cloud Platform under the Google Cloud Research Credits Program, ensuring scalability and cloud-based accessibility.
